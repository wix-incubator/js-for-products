# DOM API

In this task we will use JS to change how an element is displayed        

- Go to [example.com](http://example.com/)        
- In the task file "part8-task.js", you will find a function called "changeColor"        
- You need to find the title in the page (it has a tag of "h1")        
- After finding the title, add an onclick listener to it, that will invoke the changeColor function        
- You should also implement the changeColor function, using the dom element style.color property
