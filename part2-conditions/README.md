# Conditions

Open the sources tab in the developer tools .  
Open the snippets tab in sources (left pane)   
Copy paste the code below to a new snippet

Save as you go, right click the snippet name to run it .    
```
function multipleOrAdd(x, y) {
    let result

    // TODO - write your code here

    return result
}
```

This code runs a function (we will learn about those later).   
The function code takes 2 numbers as variables x and y     
You should implement a condition inside the function:  
if both numbers are even: set the product of x and y to **result** variable
else, set the sum of x and y to result variable          
     
     
**Hint** - a number is even if it devides by 2 with no remainder     
```
x % 2 === 0   <=> x is even
```


**Examples:**

multipleOrAdd(2, 4) -> 8       
multipleOrAdd(6, 4) -> 24       
multipleOrAdd(6, 3) -> 9       
multipleOrAdd(3, 6) -> 9       
multipleOrAdd(1, 10) -> 11
