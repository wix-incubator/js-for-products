# Final task       

In this task, we will create a simple game, that can be played in google.com website        
Open the file part9-task.js       
Copy the code inside to a new code snippet in the browser.       
There are only 3 lines you need to complete to make the code work, all of them inside the function "activateRotationGame"       

- find the element with **id** rotateRight, and put it inside a variable called "rotateRightButton"      
- find the element with **id** rotateLeft, and put it inside a variable called "rotateLeftButton"      
- inside the **setInterval** block, invoke the function **rotateBy** with the needed arguments      
      
After everything is done, run your code, and invoke activateRotationGame() in the console
